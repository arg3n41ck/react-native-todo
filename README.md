This application is a Quiz platform developed using React, Redux, react-router-dom and axios technologies. The application provides the user with the ability to take quizzes on a variety of topics.

The application is developed on the React library, which provides a fast and efficient user interface display. The Redux library is used to manage the state of the application. For routing, react-router-dom is used to easily determine the paths of the application and redirect the user to the appropriate pages.

Application data is retrieved from the server using the axios library, which is used to perform API queries. Quizzes contain questions and answers that are displayed on the user's page. Users can select answers to questions and move on to the next question.
